      <h1>Questions-01 : What is the purpose of DOM ??</h1>
      <p>
        Answer: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for
        web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
        document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document
        as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with
        the page.

      <h1>Questions-03 : What is event bubble ??</h1>
      <p>
        Answer: Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model).
        It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up
        (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor
        elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.

      <h1>Questions-04 : What is callback function,how can it work ??</h1>
      <p>
        Answer: A callback function is a function passed into another function
        as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to
        complete some kind of routine or action. The above example is a
        synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately.
